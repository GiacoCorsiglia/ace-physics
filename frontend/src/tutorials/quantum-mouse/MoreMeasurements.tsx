              Suppose I gave you a quantum mouse. You measure <M t="\hat{M}" />{" "}
              and find the eigenvalue <M t="-1" />.
            </p>
            <p>What state describes the mouse after this measurement?</p>
          </Prose>
          //Multiple choice
          <Prose>Is there any ambiguity about the state at this point?</Prose>

            What is the probability that a subsequent measurement of{" "}
            <M t="\hat{S}" /> will yield a result of <M t="1" />
            mm, i.e., "small-eyed"? (
            <em>Work it out from the postulates of quantum mechanics!</em>)

          //MC? Possibly add an explain. Hint would suggest that the postulates
          give a formula for probability and possible suggest drawing out the SG

              Consider again the measurement and outcome ‚Äúchain‚Äù given in the
              parts above:
            </p>
            <p>
              You first measured <M t="\hat{M}" />, and you happened to get{" "}
              <M t="-1" /> (This was an unhappy mouse).
            </p>
            <p>
              Then you measured <M t=" \hat{S}" /> and you happened to get{" "}
              <M t="1" /> mm.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now, you measure mood once again. What do you get (with what
              probabilities?

          //I feel like I want this one to be openended/textbox. Or we need to

        <Section>
          <Prose>
            <p>
              Think a bit about this chain of events ‚Äì is there anything at all
              curious or surprising about it (from a classical perspective?)

            <p>Thinking deeper:</p>
            <p>
              If I give you a quantum mouse whose eye-size has been measured. Is
              it fair to say: ‚ÄúThat mouse is either happy or sad. It is
              definitely one or the other, I just don‚Äôt know which, yet.‚Äù{" "}

          //textbox. But I think this question should include some detailed
          thought from our end and may include a sentence or so from an expert
