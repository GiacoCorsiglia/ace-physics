        Suppose now that I tell you that
        <M
          display
          t="\ket{0\_0} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{5}}\ket{ðŸ˜¸} + \frac{2}{\sqrt{5}} \ket{ðŸ˜¿}"
        />
      </Prose>

      <Question label="a">
        This suggests that wide-eyed quantum-mice are rather <em>stressed</em>.
        Briefly, why might I say that?
      </Question>

      <textarea className="full-text" />
    </div>
  );
