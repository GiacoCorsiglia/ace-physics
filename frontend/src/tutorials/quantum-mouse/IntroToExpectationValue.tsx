                  Suppose you have a bunch of mice (this is technically a
                  ‚Äúmischief of mice‚Äù!) They have been treated well, we check
                  their M values and sure enough - they are <em>all</em> happy.

                <p>
                  If you were to measure the <em>eye-size</em> of all the mice
                  and average the results, what would you get?

                  In QM, the answer above is called the ‚Äúexpectation value of{" "}
                  <M t="\hat{S}" />. In the case above, do you expect to ever
                  measure this particular value, in any individual measurement?

                  The ‚Äúexpectation value of <M t="\hat{S}" />‚Äù here is not
                  simply the na√Øve average, i.e. (value 1 + value 2)/2, of the
                  two possible values you might measure. Why not? Make intuitive
                  sense of the result, given your interpretations of the
                  characters of small-eyed and large-eyed mice.
