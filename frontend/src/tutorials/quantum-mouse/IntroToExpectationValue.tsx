              Suppose you have a bunch of mice (this is technically a “mischief
              of mice”!) They have been treated well, we check their M values
              and sure enough - they are <em>all</em> happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you were to measure the <em>eye-size</em> of all the mice and
              average the results, what would you get?

              <em>
                Hint: in general, the average of a bunch of measurements that
                can have two outcomes is (outcome 1)* Prob(outcome 1) + (outcome
                2) * Prob(outcome 2)

              In QM, the answer above is called the “expectation value of{" "}
              <M t="\hat{S}" />. In the case above, do you expect to ever
              measure this particular value, in any individual measurement?

              c) The “expectation value of <M t="\hat{S}" />” here is not simply
              the naïve average, i.e. (value 1 + value 2)/2, of the two possible
              values you might measure. Why not? Make intuitive sense of the
              result, given your interpretations of the characters of small-eyed
              and large-eyed mice.
