        We have represented our vector in a new basis, that is in the form{" "}
        <M t="a\ket{v_1} + b \ket{v_2}." /> An interesting question is, should
        we rename the vector in this basis to <M t="\ket{k}" />? Let's go ahead
        and do that and investigate whether we needed to.
      </Prose>

      <Question label="a">
        Now let's draw a single 2D graph showing both <M t="\ket{u}" /> and{" "}
        <M t="\ket{k}" />. You'll have to add <M t="\ket{u}" />, represent{" "}
        <M t="\ket{v_1}" /> and <M t="\ket{v_2}" /> on the graph, and then add
        the vector <M t="\ket{k}" />.

      <Question label="b">
        What is the relationship between <M t="\ket{u}" /> and <M t="\ket{k}" />

      <Question label="c">
        Using the analogy weâ€™ve created to 2-D spatial vectors, explain what
        changing the basis means for a given quantum state (in this case{" "}
        <M t="\ket{u}" />
        ).

      <Question label="d">
        Earlier we had a state <M t="\ket{u}" /> initially written in the basis
        of <M t="\ket{i}" /> and <M t="\ket{j}" />. We then converted this to a
        new basis. Was it (in retrospect) appropriate or necessary to give it a
        new name, <M t="\ket{k}" />?
