  // Place your ace-physics workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "LaTeX Math Component": {
    "scope": "javascriptreact,typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "MM",
    "body": ["<M t=\"${1:${TM_SELECTED_TEXT/Ïˆ/\\psi/g}}\" />$2"]
  },
  "Section component": {
    "scope": "javascriptreact,typescriptreact",
    "prefix": "mkSec",
    "body": ["section({ name: \"$1\", body: (m) => (<>$2</>),}),"],
    "description": "Instantly create a new section template"
  }
}
