              Any general quantum state can always be written in the form

              The Java program has a weird glitch and you will probably need to
              re-set the ‚ÄúUser State‚Äù before using it. To do this, switch to
              Unknown #1 and then back to User State. Re-set all four numbers,
              being sure to not leave any blank. Repeat this process until the
              User State shows up correctly when you check it. (Also, be sure
              the ‚ÄúChoose basis‚Äù button is selected as ‚ÄúZ‚Äù, this should be the
              default)
